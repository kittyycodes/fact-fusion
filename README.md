# Multimodal and Context-Aware Fake News Detection

## Overview
This project aims to enhance fake news detection by integrating multiple data sources—text, images, and metadata—while considering contextual information. By leveraging advanced models like BERT for textual analysis and multimodal neural networks, we improve the accuracy and adaptability of fake news identification.

## Features
- **Multimodal Detection:** Analyzes text, images, and metadata for a comprehensive understanding.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Evaluates news based on temporal and situational context.
- **Dynamic Modal Integration:** Adjusts the weighting of data sources based on their relevance and quality.
- **Real-time Analysis:** Optimized for swift live data processing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, `numpy`, `pandas`
